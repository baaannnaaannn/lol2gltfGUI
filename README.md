You need a python and a .net to run this tool (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-8.0.18-windows-x64-installer?cid=getdotnetcore)

Since lol2gltf (https://github.com/Crauzer/lol2gltf) no longer has a GUI since version 3.0.4, I made it for myself.

I. Running lol2gltf.bat file:
	Windows natively supports .bat files. Simply double-click the lol2gltf.bat file.

II. Running lol2gltf.py file:
	1. Install Python:
		1.1. Download and install Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
		1.2. During installation, make sure to check the option "Add Python to PATH". This will allow you to run Python from the Command Prompt.
	2. Verify Python Installation:
		2.1. Open Command Prompt (Win + R, type cmd, press Enter).
		2.2. Type python --version or python -V to confirm that Python is installed and accessible.
	3. Running lol2gltf.py file:
		3.1. Double-click the lol2gltf.py file (if Python is installed, it will run automatically).
		3.2. Right-click the lol2gltf.py file → "Open with" → Choose Python (if Python is installed, but Python file association not working).
